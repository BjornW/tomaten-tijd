tomaten-tijd
============

A small script using notify-send to notify the user 25 minutes have passed since starting the script. 
Used as a very minimal "Pomodoro Technique" timer. Don't forget to start tomaten-tijd after your break for the
next Pomodoro.

## Install ##

1. Download the files 
2. Unpack the files 
3. Run install.sh (this will check for dependencies and set the paths)
4. Run tomaten-tijd.sh using the commandline or double-click the tomaten-tijd.desktop launcher

## Dependencies ##

notify-send 
spd-say

Thanks to Jos√© Campos of [The Noun Project](http://thenounproject.com) for the use of the [Tomato icon](http://thenounproject.com/term/tomato/15790/)
Without the people behind notify-send and spd-say I would not have been able to put this small script together in such a small amount of time and effort. Thank you for sharing your work!

## Note ##
tomaten-tijd has only been tested on my personal install of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. It may not work on your install. 
Feel free to send patches ;)
